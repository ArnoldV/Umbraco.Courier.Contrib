# Umbraco.Courier.Contrib

#### This project contains resolvers for some of the most popular Umbraco packages in the community right now. 
Resolvers are required for making Courier (and Umbraco Cloud) capable of transferring the data stored by these packages.

We encourage you to report any issues you might find with these resolvers, so we can have them fixed for everyone!

When reporting issues with a resolver it will help us a whole lot if you can reduce your report to being the absolute minimum required to encounter the error you are seeing. This means try removing anything unnecessary or unrelated to the actual issue, from your setup and also try reducing the steps to reproduce, to only cover exactly what we would need to do in order to see the error you are getting.
